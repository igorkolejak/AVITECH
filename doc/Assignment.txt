Assignment:
Task 1 - Check the code. Your friend asked you for help, as it keeps crashing. 
Besides that, some of the functions also donÂ´t work as expected. Investigate to find
out why and edit the code to make it work properly. Keep in mind to use also the 
best pracices of clean code and OOP.

Task 2 - There is a method Person::printInfo(), which displays name and age of given
person. However, we would like to have adjusted version of this function also for class
Student, which would display the classroom number as well.

Task 3 - Create a new class for teachers. Keep in mind that we want to save teachers and
students in the same vector.

Task 4 - Some of the students have various interests(each student have only 1 interest, or none), which define what course
they want to attend. Add this implementation to the code and edit the School::addStudentToCourse, so that it checks the students interest
and assigns them to the corresponding course(lets say that there are interests: sport,history,biology).

Task 5 - There is text file attached named dataset.txt. It contains names of students and teachers. Some of the students may have interests for courses.
Write a function that will parse this file and load students and teachers to school. Keep in mind to also assign students to the courses.
